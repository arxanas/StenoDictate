# StenoDictate

StenoDictate is dictation software to help stenography students practice their
transcription. You'll never have to go trawling for YouTube videos at the right
speech rate again.

You give StenoDictate a text, and it dictates it to you so that you can
transcribe it.  The dictation speed is fully customizable. Once you're done
transcribing, StenoDictate takes your transcription and grades it for you,
shortening the feedback loop so you can practice smarter.
